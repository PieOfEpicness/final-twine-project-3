I’ve always been curious. To my own detriment, really. When I was younger, when we were visiting family in India, I went inside a cave.

Amma and Papa wanted me to become a doctor, or a lawyer, yet my heart lied with journalism. I’d only been an investigative journalist for a few years when I came across some rumours on a message board. Multiple deaths, always on a full moon.
=|=
Locals suspected a werewolf, but I suspected a less-than-creative serial killer. I pitched the story to my editor, and he told me to get the facts.
=|=
&lt;img class="story-image-medium" src="./images/human-hand-chair2.jpeg" alt= "human hand chair"/&gt;The facts were… way more than I could bring back to my editor. I found the place, an abandoned warehouse just outside of Albany, New York. Owned by the REDACTED Corporation.
=|=
I found the bodies before they did. Tried my best to help one escape before the [[human hand chair]] pulled them away. It nearly got me, too. I ran out before it could, but that’s when I ran into the [[agents.]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="5" name="agents." tags="" position="1225,350" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-big" src="./images/broken-camera.jpg" alt="a camera" /&gt;

I’d never heard of the Bureau of Control before, then I was being threatened to be charged with obstruction in the apprehension of a paranatural object. Told me to destroy the memory card in my camera. I stalled, watching as the other agents carted away a large black brick box to a van nearby, but then the agent took the camera out of my hands, destroyed it and the memory card before I could say [[anything.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="6" name="human hand chair" tags="" position="1100,225" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-large" src="./images/human-hand-chair-procedures.jpg" alt= "hand chair procedures" /&gt;
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="7" name="anything." tags="" position="1350,350" size="100,100">That was how I lost my first job, but I quickly gained another. With the quickly growing pile of unpaid bills came a letter with a curious sigil on it.

Inside the letter was the business card of Alberto Tommasi, Head of Communications at the Federal Bureau of Control. The building they were housed in was curious to say the least. It felt like it had always been there, but just out of eyeshot, right in the middle of the financial district in NYC. I must’ve walked by it a few dozen times just walking to work without ever having realised it was [[there.]]

&lt;img class="story-image-medium" src="./images/fbc-bc-front.jpg" alt="bc front" /&gt;
&lt;img class="story-image-medium" src="./images/fbc-bc-back.jpg" alt="bc back" /&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="8" name="there." tags="" position="1475,350" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-big" src="./images/messy-desk.jpg" alt= "desk" /&gt;

I loved my job at the Bureau. My curiosity was well fed and never hindered, especially by the weird, and what I quickly realised was paranatural. I started out small, just going through the letters and calls that the Bureau received, sorting out what needed investigating and what didn’t. I slowly moved my way up, making the occasional side step, but I relished in every single challenge thrown my way. Five years after my employment, I was Mr Tommasi’s assistant, being groomed for a role that I may one day take over.

Though, I don’t know if that’ll happen [[now.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="9" name="now." tags="" position="1600,350" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-big" src="./images/man-walking-dark.jpg" alt= "man walking" /&gt;

Tommasi has been acting strange over the past few weeks. He’s becoming erratic, aggressive and distrustful. He spends long hours by himself, and won't talk to anyone, not even me. I do my best to keep the Department running, but it’s hard without the captain of the ship. I only have so much [[power.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="10" name="power." tags="" position="1725,350" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-large"src="./images/darling-portrait.jpg" alt="darling portrait"/&gt;

Dr. Darling and his assistant, Emily, stopped by a while ago. Darling said there was an imminent threat facing the Bureau, and we needed to protect ourselves. Tommasi laughed in his face, and told him to get out of his office. 

&lt;img class="story-image-large"src="./images/emily-pope.jpg" alt="emily"/&gt;

Outside, Emily begged me to put a device, an HRA, on and though she didn’t elaborate on why, I trusted her. I kept it on, even when Tommasi told the rest of the Department to ignore Darling’s warning. Some of them took my lead, but most [[didn’t.]]
</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="didn’t." tags="" position="1850,350" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-large"src="./images/alberto.jpg" alt="alberto"/&gt;

I was with Tommasi when the alarms went off. He was angrily ranting about something under his breath when he suddenly stopped, every muscle in his body going rigid, his breathing ragged, his eyes rolling into the back of his head, revealing the bloodshot whites. A red glow gradually came into view, surrounding him.

&lt;img class="story-image-large" src="./images/alberto-hiss.jpg" alt="hiss-alberto"/&gt;

I didn’t have time to think about getting into a safe room as he lifted from the floor, flying down the corridor, and the floor dropped from [[beneath me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="beneath me." tags="" position="1975,350" size="100,100">I knew the Oldest House was… alive in some sense. It moved, floors and rooms (align:"==&gt;")[shifting,] people sometimes going missing. Maybe we were just food, slowly moving through its guts, (align:"==&gt;")[and it was my turn to be digested.] I never really thought it would be my turn, it had been years since the House had shifted like this. (align:"==&gt;")[I screamed as I slid down into the [[darkness.]]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="13" name="darkness." tags="" position="2100,350" size="100,100">I’m not sure when I came to a stop, I’d scrunched my eyes closed hard, arms covering my head, every muscle clenched, my mind dissociating as I accepted my fate. I realised I was still breathing, that I was no longer moving, my muscles aching from how long they’d been squeezed. I kept my eyes closed for a little while longer, feeling like a child again, scared to look around a dark bedroom after waking in the middle of the [[night.]]

I got up instead. I wanted to see my family again. I began to walk in the first direction that I chose.

[[Go back.]]

[[Go left.]]

[[Go right.]]

[[Go forward.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="15" name="Go back." tags="" position="2350,475" size="100,100">

I turned left, and I walked for a while, but hit a black stone wall.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="17" name="Go right." tags="" position="2500,475" size="100,100">&lt;img class="story-image-large" src="./images/paragraph-text.jpg" alt="paragraph"/&gt;

I pulled myself up, looking down the hallway in front [[of me.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="18" name="Go forward." tags="" position="2475,350" size="100,100">I went onward, the slope leading me down, until it led me to an edge. There was a path on the other side, the gap between something I could jump across. I thought about it. I could do the safe thing, turn back and try another way, or take the leap.

There was nowhere for me to go behind, so I decided to take the leap. I backed up to take a running start, taking a deep breath, not letting myself worry about what would happen if I didn’t make it.

&lt;source src="./video/let-you-in.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

It led straight into the dark, I couldn’t see where it ended. I put my hand on the wall to guide myself, and down the hallway I went.

In the distance I could hear the low cacophony of thousands of voices, chanting in unison. I couldn’t make out what they were saying, but I knew those were the voices of my coworkers. 

My friends. 

The ones that weren’t wearing [[HRAs.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="20" name="HRAs." tags="video" position="2725,350" size="100,100">&lt;video autoplay loop muted class="background-video"&gt;
&lt;source src="./video/let-you-in.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

I had to stop for a moment, I leaned against the wall, the realisation hitting me like a ton of bricks. I was stuck in the bowels of the Oldest House, my friends and coworkers were probably dead, and I would be soon, too. If I couldn’t find a way out. I could feel the hopelessness fighting within me, the fear, the anxiety, all fighting to keep me in place. I wanted to give in, I wanted to give [[up.]]

&lt;img class="story-image-medium" src="./images/scared.jpg" alt="scared"/&gt;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="up." tags="video" position="2850,350" size="100,100">&lt;video autoplay loop muted class="background-video"&gt;

&lt;/video&gt;

(align:"=&gt;&lt;=")[I couldn’t, though. The curiosity wouldn’t let me. I wanted to see this through to the end. I wanted to find the way

&lt;source src="./video/let-you-in.mp4" type="video/mp4"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

I kept going, hand on the wall, for what felt like hours. Over time, the chanting grew louder, some of it became understandable, but most of it sounded like nonsense.

The noise was incessant, wanting to burrow into my brain, but I knew the HRA on my chest was the only thing keeping it at bay, making sure it was nothing but a nuisance to my ears and not in my head. 

Not taking me [[over.]]

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="23" name="over." tags="" position="3100,350" size="100,100">In the darkness ahead, I saw something glowing. I was spurred on, picked up my pace, and saw on the ground a white piece of paper. The brightest thing in the place. I reached down to pick it up, and it disappeared with a whoosh. I saw it a few feet away. I reached out again.

It was an altered item, one of the [[moving letters]]. I’d processed these when they first arrived in the Dead Letters department a few years into my employment. They didn’t used to be able to move so far or so quickly, usually only moving a couple of inches away. I hastened to grab the pen from my pocket, knowing I’d only have so much time to write a note before the letter disappeared.

Perhaps a futile hope, as it left after I only scribbled down three letters. 

//HEL//

I tried not to not let it get to me. I took a deep breath. All was not lost, I told [[myself.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="myself." tags="" position="3350,350" size="100,100">So I kept going.

Deeper and deeper into the bowels of the House I went. I could feel a constant rumble from the floor, walls and ceiling. There was a constant chill in the air, every exhale sending a wave of steam [[above me.]]

As I walked, I thought about Amma. I wanted my Amma to hold me in her arms, smell the comforting aroma of spices wafting in from the kitchen, her pithla bhakri simmering on the stove. I could almost taste it, could feel naan between my fingers as I scooped it from the [[bowl-]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="33" name="bowl-" tags="" position="4350,350" size="100,100">I (text-rotate-z:6)[[slipped.]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="34" name="slipped." tags="" position="4475,350" size="100,100">I

&lt;/video&gt;

I seriously considered stopping here. I reached up to the straps of my HRA, just touching them for a moment. I also felt the lanyard of my ID, still attached to my pocket. I took it off, looking down at it.

&lt;img class="story-image-large" src="./images/maya-chowdhury-id.jpg" alt="maya's id" /&gt;

I nodded, letting my ID fall to the ground. Started slowly undoing the straps. I wouldn’t see my family again, and neither would hundreds of others. I cried as I let the hopelessness overtake me. I would never get out, I would never-</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="39" name="I want to keep fighting." tags="" position="4975,350" size="100,100">I gripped my ID tighter, feeling renewed.

I had to shield my eyes as bright light shone on me.

It was a vent. With no other choice, I slid down, crawling along on my hands and [[knees.]]

&lt;img class="story-image-large" src="./images/vent.jpg" alt="vent" /&gt;

I wondered where in the House I was. The gunshots and explosions and screaming had long since died down. I hadn’t even heard the chanting since I heard [[the humming.]]

I got to a fork, and wondered which way to go. From the right I could smell something sweet, my mouth watering from the scent. I could feel the pull to investigate, my stomach rumbling, needing to eat. 

From the left, the humming continued. I wanted to know who it was.

[[Crawl right.]]

[[Crawl left.]]


</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="44" name="Crawl right." tags="" position="5475,475" size="100,100">As I made my decision to go right, the humming behind me stopped.

//Don’t go that way. That way bad. You’ll never come back. You’ll never be you again.//

I ignored it, my hunger over taking me. Onward I crawled, turning another corner, until I found the source of the smell. It looked like mushrooms. Eagerly, I reached out, plucking one of the pink caps, and putting it in my mouth. Ravenous, I stuffed my mouth, eating and eating, ignoring the tingling in my throat as the spores burrowed themselves into my veins.

I made my decision to go left. The voice gave a pleasant noise before returning to its humming. As I crawled, I saw a vision of my parents house overtake my sight like a mirage. As I got closer, it started to fade, and I reached for the handle before it could [[disappear.]]

I opened the door, finding a janitor’s office, with an old man sitting casually at his desk, humming as he flipped through a magazine. He didn’t seem surprised as I crawled out from the vent, standing up before [[him.]]

(align:"==&gt;")[I gulped. “Pithla bhakri?”]

“Fresh naan, too,” he unwraps a cloth surrounding a few metal containers. “And some dessert from my homeland, //mustikkapiirakkaa//. Finnish blueberry pie. Come, you must be hungry.”

(align:"==&gt;")[“Am I really out?” I asked quietly, too afraid of the fact that it wouldn’t be.]

“Yes. Though the House is still in lockdown, so no home yet. My assistant Jesse works on it, should be over soon.” He waves a hand at the other side of the desk, telling me to sit.

(align:"==&gt;")[“Who are you?” I ask, staring at the wise, weathered face of the man. “I’ve seen you around, but… I never asked for your name.”]

“Is okay. My name is Ahti. I do my job well if you don’t notice me.”

(align:"==&gt;")[“Thank you, Ahti.” I scooped the pithla bhakri with the naan, letting out a few happy tears as I tasted it. “This tastes just like my Amma’s.”]

“It is your Amma’s,” Ahti said, humming in contentment from his own bite. “Very good. Your mother is wonderful cook.”

(align:"==&gt;")[“She is,” I smiled. “I can’t wait to see her. And my Papa.”]

“Yes, yes, very soon. You just have important decision to make,” he looks at me seriously. “The House needs new Director of Communications.” I dropped my naan into my pithla bhakri. “Is important job.”

(align:"==&gt;")[“It is…” I agree. I thought back to my journey. How I was taken away at just the right moment. The House almost guiding me down the right path. “The House was protecting me, wasn’t it?”]

“A little bit House, a little bit me. New job, big legacy, more responsibility.”

(align:"==&gt;")[“It would be…” it would also mean less time for my family. But it had been something I had been working towards for a decade. Alberto had taken me under his wing for this reason. (text-colour:red)[[“I]]

I came across tree roots, feeling like they were placed in my path. They were giant, leaving only a small gap for me to worm my way through. I must be under the Research Sector, with their giant Redwoods. I used to go there on the days when I didn’t bring my lunch in, the Research cafeteria had the best tater tots in the building. I remembered seeing the janitor there, caring for the plants and the trees, talking to them as he laid down fresh mulch.

Ajéi and Iina, I’d heard him call them. I could feel them pulsing around me as I crawled my way through. At least they were still alive, these two pure things remained uncorrupted by whatever had [[invaded.]]

It was dark, but I could see enough to know that it wasn’t damaged. I didn’t think I would still be myself if it was. I looked around, unable to see the ceiling or the sides of the room.

Wherever I was, it was
